      <h3>How to Play</h3>
      <p>
        Your First Steps into the World of Pokémon TCG
      </p>
      <p>
        New to the Pokémon Trading Card Game? You’re in the right place! The How to Play section of PokePro is 
        designed to make learning the basics easy and fun, even if you’ve never played before. Here, we’ll guide 
        you through everything you need to know, from understanding card types and setting up a game to mastering 
        the flow of battle. With clear tutorials, interactive guides, and helpful tips, you’ll be ready to jump 
        into your first match in no time. Let’s get started on your journey to becoming a Pokémon TCG trainer!
      </p>
      <p>
        First, lets look at a standard Pokémon card. Each card contains a lot of information! It might even seem 
        overwhelming, but don't worry. Overtime you'll develop the ability to quickly find the information you need,
        while leaving the extra detail for later. 
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>At the top is the card name. When building a deck, you may only have 4 cards of the same name in your deck. </li>
        <li>In the top right is the HP and TYPE. HP stands for Hit Points,
        and refers to how much damage it can take before being knocked out. The type is what matters when it comes
        to the weaknesses and advantages shown at the bottom of the card. The type can also sometimes be relevant
        in type-specific abilities. </li>
        <li>The top left shows the Pokemon's "stage." This refers to evolution which we will explain more later.</li>
        <li>The middle section of the card shows attacks an abilities. Attacks have energy symbols showing their cost,
        and will usually have a damage amount shown on the right. Abilities are hard to distinguish but if you look closely,
        they have a big red label that says "ability"</li>
        <li>Finally, on the bottom right you can see the Pokemon's retreat cost. This refers to how much energy you must 
        dispose in order to retreat that Pokemon.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Don't worry if you don't remember all of that, you can always refer back to this page later. Now, let's look at
        the playmat:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Active Spot: This is where the "Active" Pokemon resides. The "Active" Pokemon is the one that is in combat
          with the opponent's active Pokemon. It will usually use attacks to damage the opponent's active pokemon, and
          recieve damage the same way.</li>
        <li>Prize Cards: Whenever you knock out an opponent's Pokemon, you take a prize card! The first player to draw all
          6 of their prize cards first wins!</li>
        <li>Bench: The bench can hold up to 5 Pokemon. This is where you can prepare your Pokemon before moving them
          to the Active Spot. Whenever the Active Pokemon is knocked out, then a Pokemon from the bench must take its
          place. If there aren't any, then that players loses.</li>
        <li>Deck: Each player starts with their own deck of 60 cards to play the game. While both players know how many 
          cards are in each deck, no one can look at or change the order of the cards in either player's deck unless a card says so.</li>
        <li>Each player has their own discard pile. Cards taken out of play go to the discard pile, unless a card is played that 
          says otherwise. Typically when a Pokémon is Knocked Out, it and any attached cards (such as Energy cards) are sent 
          to its owner's discard pile.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Setup:
      </p>
      <p>
        To start playng your first game of Pokemon, we'd reccomend using a basic pre-built deck you can find at Walmart or Target.
        The "ex Battle Decks" tend to go for $15 or less, and are a great way to start learning for cheap. Or, if you want a
        slightly stronger deck, the "Delux Battle Decks" only cost a few dollars more, and are considerably stronger.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>First: Shake your opponent's hand, and shuffle your deck. Flip a coin to decide who goes first. Draw 7 cards, and chose 
          a "basic" pokemon you find there to be your "active pokemon" and set it face down in the active spot. If you don't find one, 
          show your hand to your opponent, shuffle it back into your deck, and draw a new 7 cards. Your opponent gets to draw an extra 
          card. Once you've both chosen an active Pokemon, you may put up to 5 other "basic" Pokemon from your hand on to your bench face down.</li>
        <li>Now, set aside 6 cards from the top of your deck face down. These are your "Prize Cards"</li>
        <li>Once both players are ready, flip over both of the "Active" Pokemon, and all of the benched Pokemon. The first player may now
          draw a card, and begin his turn!</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Advanced Strategies</h3>  
      <p>
        Welcome to Advanced Strategies – Where Mastery Begins
      </p>
      <p>
        You’ve mastered the basics, and now it’s time to level up! The Advanced Strategies section of PokePro is 
        dedicated to helping seasoned players like you outsmart the competition, refine your deck-building skills, 
        and dive into expert techniques. Here, you’ll find in-depth guides on complex game mechanics, winning card 
        combinations, and insights into high-level tournament play. Ready to unlock the secrets of top players? Let’s 
        get started and transform your game with cutting-edge tactics that give you a competitive edge.
      </p>
      <p>One of the most helpful resources for playing competitive pokemon is Limitless TCG. Limitless TCG has the biggest and most up to date
        data base of Pokemon Tournament results. Using this website you can see what the most popular decks are, view statistics and results From
        recent events, and even view the decklists of top players. If you're not sure what kinda of deck to use, picking a deck from the top
        decks list is a pretty safe choice.
      </p>
      <p>Something that's helpful to understand when deckbuilding is something called the "metagame" or "meta" for short. The key concept to
        develop is understanding what decks other people will likely play. Once again, Limitless TCG is an excelent resource for this. If you
        have a good idea of what decks other people will play, then you can choose and modify your deck accordingly. For example, a major Deck
        right now is "Snorlax Stall." Snorlax Stall is a deck that focusses on finding cards that can shut down your opponents. So it's important
        to know what your opponents are using. For anyone not using Snorlax Stall right now, it's important to have cards to counter it like
        cancelling cologne.</p>
