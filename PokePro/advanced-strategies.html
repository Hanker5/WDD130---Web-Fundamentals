        <p>One of the most helpful resources for playing competitive pokemon is Limitless TCG. Limitless TCG has the biggest 
            and most up to date data base of Pokemon Tournament results. Using this website you can see what the most popular 
            decks are, view statistics and results From recent events, and even view the decklists of top players. If you're not 
            sure what kinda of deck to use, picking a deck from the top decks list is a pretty safe choice.</p>

        <p>Something that's helpful to understand when deckbuilding is something called the "metagame" or "meta" for short. The 
            key concept to develop is understanding what decks other people will likely play. Once again, Limitless TCG is an 
            excelent resource for this. If you have a good idea of what decks other people will play, then you can choose and 
            modify your deck accordingly. For example, a major Deck right now is "Snorlax Stall." Snorlax Stall is a deck that 
            focusses on finding cards that can shut down your opponents. So it's important to know what your opponents are using. 
            For anyone not using Snorlax Stall right now, it's important to have cards to counter it like cancelling cologne.</p>
