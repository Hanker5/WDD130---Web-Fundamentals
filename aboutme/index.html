    <p>Heya! I'm majoring in Computer Science. I enjoy playing guitar, rock climbing, and video games! My dream job is to one day develop video games for a small indie studio. Web development is pretty important for me in that endeavor! Partly because I have to take this class for my degree, but also because I will likely apply it in the field.</p>
    <p>I've been a member of the church my whole life, but really had a personal conversion moment when I was struggling in high school. I ended up deciding to go on a mission! I was called to the Canada Winnipeg Mission and I loved it there!</p>
    <p>I'm really looking forward to developing with all of you!</p>
